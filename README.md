##Idea of the project 

*note: this will be completely re-written in user friendly format*

Main goal: implementation of SA algorithm for real 2-D function extremal analysis.

Steps: 
- set the functions to be used (move, cooling, criteria ecc)
- write the functions to be tested (maybe find out specific ones)
- write the algorithm using the guidelines from literature
- Use a run file for code management, it would be nice to add the possibility for the user to choose parameters or functions to be minimized.
- plots
- comments/PEP8
- Readme!
